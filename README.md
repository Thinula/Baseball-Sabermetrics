# Baseball-Sabermetrics
This is my attempt to perform some data analysis on professional baseball players. <br />
Currently interested in how best to assign payroll for each player based on their stats. <br />
The data being used was taken from http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2014/07/baseball-analytics/.
